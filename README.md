# Vector Calculator (Initial Version - Lab 5)

This version of the Vector Calculator implements basic 3D vector operations
(addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product) using a static array
for vector storage.

## How It Works
- Vectors are stored in a fixed-size array.
- Operations are performed directly in memory (no dynamic resizing).
- Results print to the console.

## How to Build
```bash
make clean
make
./vectorcalcS
